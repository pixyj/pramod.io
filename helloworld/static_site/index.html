<p>Let's say you come across a problem at work which requires knowledge of Principal Components Analysis(PCA). Your friend recommends the popular &quot;Introduction to Linear Algebra&quot; book by Gilbert Strang. You find that it is explained on Page 457.  But your Linear Algebra is a bit rusty and you'd prefer to reach <code>PCA</code> as fast as possible.</p>
<p>What if there was a way to only learn concepts which are required to understand <code>PCA</code> instead of studying each concept from page 1 to page 457 in detail?</p>
<p><em>Enter Concept Coaster</em></p>
<p><strong>Instructor</strong>: Concept Coaster helps the instructor to split a large topic into small, atomic concepts and specify dependencies between them. The instructor can also create text and multimedia content, quizzes and coding exercises pertaining to each concept in the topic.</p>
<p><strong>Student</strong>: When a student visits the site for the first time, Concept Coaster guides the student through an adaptive pre-test using the information entered by the instructor to identify the student's current knowledge level so that the student can starting learning at the edge of their knowledge instead of wasting time reviewing known concepts. Also, the entire concept graph is visualized on the main page so that the student can choose a learning path optimized for reaching their target concept as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans:</strong></p>
<p>Major Goals for the next 4 years are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a concept graph of all the topics in a typical undergrad Computer Science curriculum.</li>
<li>Develop visual tutorials for Linear Algebra and Compilers.</li>
<li>Curate resources on tough topics like Theory of Computation and NP-Complete problems.</li>
<li>Calculate PageRank for concepts based on the concept graph, and highlight important concepts to students before they embark on their journey of learning so that they can allocate more time to these concepts.</li>
<li>Build a problem-solving component to help students develop both creative and analytical problem solving capabilities.</li>
<li>Use machine learning to identify latent dependencies between concepts and discover links between seemingly unrelated concepts by leveraging students' responses to quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds interesting? <a href="https://github.com/pixyj/feel">Watch the project on GitHub</a></p>

                    <h3>An assessment and analytics platform for K-12 students and schools</h3>
<p>I was an early employee at <a href="newrubric.com">New Rubric Solutions</a> Here are some accomplishments during my time with the company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead the development of the company's flagship online assessment web application.</li>
<li>Contributed to architecture/design and lead the development of a reporting application used by parents to keep track of their child's progress at school.</li>
<li>Designed and developed core abstractions used by product engineers to build maintainable applications. (My libraries are still being be used one year later without any issues and major modifications)</li>
<li>Mentored interns and teammates on front-end development and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the major highlights was building a web app to generate student reports by aggregating thousands of data points collected from each student through assignments and additional inputs by teachers. The report had to look beautiful on print and fit within 6 pages even though each student had different data associated with them.</p>
<p>Oh, and the product had to be built and deployed within 4 weeks by a team consisting of a sole full-stack developer(me), a couple of senior backend developers, an enthusiastic intern and an awesome QA. This required working on nights and weekends, a bunch of PhantomJS tricks, detailed attention to each pixel, autoscaling our infrastructure to handle increased load during the Parents' Teachers' meeting season, and dozens of late-night debugging sessions with teammates to workaround <code>@media print</code> issues.</p>
<p>But it was all worth it when we printed the reports and received positive feedback from delighted parents.</p>
<p>Here are a few sample reports: (They look better when printed!)</p>
